INTRODUCTION                    *conflict*

This plugin is a utility for opening all git conflicting files in buffers with the `:Conflicts` command.
It works by running `git diff --name-only` command which returns the name of all conflicting files.
We then turn it into a one liner and open all the files using the 

<
  args some/file1 some/file2
>

command.

REQUIREMENTS                    *conflict-requirements*

git 

MISC                            *conflict-misc*

vim-conflict should be a global plugin, so not tied to any FileType.
